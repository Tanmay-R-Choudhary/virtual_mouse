# Virtual Mouse

This repository contains all the files required to build a program that can be used to control a mouse using the hand.

Touching the index and the thumb fingers results in a mouse down event. Hence, touch once for a left click, twice for a double click, and hold down for a long press.

The gui is made using dearpygui. The gui folder can be compiled into a executable using something like pyinstaller.
